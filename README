CS 342 homework 2
-----------------

To compile a file into a class, simply type 'make file.class'. To run the ExamTester class, type 'make test'. 
'make test' will not work if the ExamTester class is not already compiled. On line 134, uncomment the code
to see what answers for MCQuestions were selected. Selected answers have brackets around them and unselected 
answers have just parentheses. HTML files with method descriptions can be generated by typing 
"javadoc somejavafile.java" (not true for newer java files). 

ExamGrader: When run, it prompts for a exam file to be loaded in (sample.txt). Then, it will prompt for a 
answers file (savedStudentAnswers.txt). Then, it will grade the exam and ask for a csv file to store the scores
(scores.csv).
